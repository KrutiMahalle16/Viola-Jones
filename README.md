# Viola-Jones
Face Detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm
This project implements face detection using the Viola-Jones algorithm with OpenCV in Python. Viola-Jones is one of the earliest and most popular real-time face detection methods, known for its speed and accuracy.

üìå What is the Viola-Jones Algorithm?
The Viola-Jones algorithm detects objects using:

Haar-like features for pattern recognition

Integral image for fast feature computation

AdaBoost for feature selection

Cascade Classifier for efficient multi-stage detection

It is primarily used for face detection in real-time applications.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)
